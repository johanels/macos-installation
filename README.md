MacOS Installation Scripts

Using Homebrew to reinstall a MacOS machine. This is slightly different in that I'm using multiple bah scripts, and not everything in one. This means you can pick the one you want and just run that.

No guarantees so check what installs when...

Always start by getting Brew installed with the default packages for Cask and MAS.

```bash
brew.sh # Setup brew and default apps for rest of scripts.
```

```bash
applefree.sh # Apple App Store free apps
applepurchased.sh # Apple App Store purchased apps
avproduction.sh # Audio/Video Production tools
development.sh # Development tools
networking.sh # Networking tools
terminals.sh # Terminal setup and tools
updates.sh # Update evenrything
virtualization.sh # Virtualization tools
```
